# Tithe-Tracker
An android finance application that uses a local database to conveniently store user's income information.

## What I learned:
- The process to build an Android application from scratch all the way to being published onto the Google Play Store.
- How to create and manage a customized ListView with multiple objects (including a button).
- How to use basic database operations with SQLite intergrated in the backend of the application.
- Worked with AsyncTask to run tasks in background so the user wouldn't have to wait for the database operations to use other features of the app.
